class Cooldown:
    """A cooldown class, checking the delta time between start and now.

        cooldown = Cooldown(5)

    A trigger class to wait for n seconds.

    If started, it saves the current time as t0.  On every check, it compares
    the then current time with t0 and returns as 'cold' if the cooldown time
    has passed.

    The cooldown can be paused, in which case it saves the time left.  On
    restart, it'll set again t0 to the remaining time and continues to compare
    as normal against the left cooldown time.

    At any time, the cooldown can be reset to its initial or a new value.

    Parameters:

        duration: float - Seconds to cool down

    Attributes:

        remaining: float        - "temperature" to cool down from
        duration: float         - default to initialize the cooldown after each reset()
        normalized: float       - property that maps remaining into an interval between 0 and 1
        paused: bool = False    - to temporarily disable the cooldown
        hot: bool               - there is stil time remaining before cooldown
        cold: bool              - time of the cooldown has run out

    Methods:

        reset()
        reset(new_cooldown_time)

            set t0 to now, remove pause state, optionally set duration to new
            value

        start()

            Start the cooldown again after a pause.

            The cooldown is started at creation time, but can be immediately
            paused by chaining.  See pause below.

        pause()

            remember time left, stop comparing delta time.  This can also be
            used to create an cooldown that's not yet running by chaining to
            the constructor:

                cooldown = Cooldown(10).pause()
