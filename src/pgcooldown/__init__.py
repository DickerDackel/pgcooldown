"""Cooldown & co...

This module started with just the Cooldown class, which can be used check if a
specified time has passed.  It is mostly indended to be used to control
objects in a game loop, but it is general enough for other purposes as well.

    fire_cooldown = Cooldown(1, cold=True)
    while True:
        if fire_shot and fire_cooldown.cold():
            fire_cooldown.reset()
            launch_bullet()

        ...

With the usage of Cooldown on ramp data (e.g. a Lerp between an opaque and a
fully transparent sprite over the time of n seconds), I came up with the
LerpThing.  The LerpThing gives you exactly that.  A lerp between `from` and
`to` mapped onto a `duration`.

    alpha = LerpThing(0, 255, 5)
    while True:
        ...
        sprite.set_alpha(alpha())
        # or sprite.set_alpha(alpha.v)

        if alpha.finished:
            sprite.kill()

Finally, the need to use Cooldown for scheduling the creations of game
objects, the CronD class was added.  It schedules functions to run after a
wait period.

Note, that CronD doesn't do any magic background timer stuff, it needs to be
updated in the game loop.

    crond = CronD()
    crond.add(1, create_enemy(screen.center))
    crond.add(2, create_enemy(screen.center))
    crond.add(3, create_enemy(screen.center))
    crond.add(4, create_enemy(screen.center))

    while True:
        ...
        crond.update()

class LerpThing:
    """A time based generic gauge that lerps between 2 points.

    This class can be used for scaling, color shifts, momentum, ...

    It gets initialized with 2 Values for t0 and t1, and a time `duration`,
    then it lerps between these values.

    Once the time runs out, the lerp can stop, repeat from start or bounce back
    and forth.

    An optional easing function can be put on top of `t`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vt0,
    vt1: [int | float]
        The endpoints of the lerp at `t == 0` and `t == 1`

    duration: Cooldown
        The length of the lerp.  This duration is mapped onto the range 0 - 1
        as `t`.

        This is a Cooldown object, so all configuration and query options
        apply, if you want to modify the lerp during its runtime.

        Note: If duration is 0, vt0 is always returned.

    ease: callable = lambda x: x
        An optional easing function to put over t

    repeat: int = 0
        After the duration has passed, how to proceed?

            0: Don't repeat, just stop transmogrifying
            1: Reset and repeat from start
            2: Bounce back and forth.  Note, that bounce back is implemented by
               swapping vt0 and vt1.

    ----
    This is a proof of concept.  This might or might not stay in here, the
    interface might or might not change.  I'm not sure if this has any
    advantages over a property, except not having so much boilerplate in your

    In contrast to a normal LerpThing, you access the `AutoLerpThing`
    like a normal attribute, not like a method call.
